## Projects

Projects are tasks that will implement all concepts mentioned in a chapter, projects serve as a 
oppitunity for you to develop a solution to a given task in any way you may deem fit. Talk to your
coach if you need any advice or support.

Upon completion, reflecting upon your solution with your coach is recommended. Recieving feedback
will identify areas of your code that can be optimised such as:
- efficency
- readability
- maintainability

## Examples

Examples will provide code of projects done by students or coaches that others can read through for
ideas or inspiration. This is also a resource to learn new approaches to problems and reconsiders
others ways to problem solve. This will also improve your ability to read a other peoples code - an
essential skill in industry!
