# 1.    Create two variables named x and y and assign both a number,
#       Add these two variables together and print the result.


# 1a.   Use type hints


# 1c.   What happens when you assign a variable z to 1.5 but hint as a int not a float?
#       Will this cause an error?


# 2.    Create a list of unordered numbers, sort them, then print each element in the list.


# 3.    Create a dict of type where the key is a name of a student and the value is their grade


# 3a.   Print Elenor's grade from the dict and print 'Elenor has a grade of GRADE%'.


# 3b.   Change the value of Jeff's grade to 98. print this out as you did with Elenor's
