# 1.    Create a function that can add two numbers together, can it take integers and floats?
# 1a.   add "hello" and "world", what is the output?

# 2.    Create two classes of any animal, these classes should contain the age and name of the animal,
# 2a.   Create two methods for each class called info and speak, info should print the age and name of the animal,
#       Speak should print out the noise the animal makes (e.g. a dog "barks")

# 2b.   Use a for each loop to call info and speak from the cat and dog classes, pack these objects into a tuple to do this.
