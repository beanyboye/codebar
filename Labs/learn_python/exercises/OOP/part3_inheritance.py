# 1.    Create a parent class called Life and create a constructor which takes
#       the kingdom of the life form, the name and it's life expectancy

# 1a.   Create a function called info which prints the following:
#       _NAME_ belongs to the _KINGDOM_ kingdom and has a life expectancy of _LIFE_EXPECTANCY_

# 2.    Create a subclass of Life called Cat and create a constructor with the same arguments as Life, add speak as the final argument.
# 2a.   call super() constructor to initialise animal type in the cat constructor (thus inheriting all of Lifes properties, functions)

# 2b.   Create a function called greet which prints speak.    

# 3.    Initialise a new cat variable, print it's name and call greet()
