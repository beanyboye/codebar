# CodeBar Labs - Overview
This repository is for those that wish to practice their programming knowledge! The exercises provided range from complete beginner
to more advanced, there is something for everyone! We also provide solutions to each lab, which should help students develop thier
confidence in reading other peoples code and to intoduce new approaches to problems you may not have thought about. Note that these 
labs should be used alongside guidance of a coach and with prior explaination of the topic, it is important to understand the fundemental 
**principles** behind why you would want/need to use tools such as loops and functions and when using them is appropriate.

Beyond practice labs, there will be a _conclusive_ lab that will test you on all topics covered in a specific chapter. 
These labs will provide a context where what you have learned is applied to real problems. It is as important to understand 
the use case for tools as much as the logic behind them! You can find more information of specific projects by heading to the 
**Projects** subsection in each chapter.
